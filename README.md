# Campus-Placement-Prediction
Campus placement is an activity of participating, identifying and hiring young talent for internships and entry level positions. Reputation and yearly admissions of the institute invariably depend upon the placements provided by the institute to the students. Therefore, most of the institutions, assiduously, try to boost their placement department in order to improve their organization on a full scale. Any assistance during this specific space can have a good impact on the institute's capability to position it's students. In this study, the target is to analyze student's placement data of last year and use it to determine the probability of campus placement of the present students. For this we have experimented with four different machine learning algorithms i.e. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbours and Random Forest.
